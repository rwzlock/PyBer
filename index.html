        <h1>Pyber Homework Description</h1>
        <br>
        <p>In this homework we had to analyze different types of Uber rides and see if 
            there were trends in ride cost and ride distance based on city type (rural,
            suburban, or urban)
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I found that rural areas typically gave fewer rides that were much longer
            and cost a lot more. Whereas urban areas gave the most rides but the rides 
            were much shorter.<br> Lastly, drivers gave many more total rides in a rural area,
            whereas it seemed to be much more of a side job for urban drivers.
